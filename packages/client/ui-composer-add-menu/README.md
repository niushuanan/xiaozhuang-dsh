# `@deepseek-ai/dsh-composer-add-menu`

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

Native one-layer add directory for the Web composer. It replaces the temporary Profile package and occupies `conversation.input.add` without creating another command, attachment, or reference protocol.

The first group reuses the conversation owner's image-validation path and Workspace file/folder picker. The **Commands, plugins and skills** group then lists the current Session's official Host command catalog first, followed by the remaining slash-provided Skills. Selecting an entry inserts `/name ` at the textarea selection and never executes it immediately. If an official command and a Skill share a name, the official command wins.

Every Skill row uses the existing `IconSkillOutline16`; official commands use the existing plugin icon. The menu closes on selection, outside pointer, Escape, or when the composer becomes disabled, while preserving native textarea focus behavior.

## Model Experience

### Local draft insertion

#### What the model sees

Nothing at selection time. Choosing a row only edits the local `/name` draft; the command or Skill reaches the model only if the user later sends it through the existing composer flow.

#### Token effect

Opening the menu and selecting a row consumes no model tokens. A later send has the same token effect as typing the slash entry manually.

#### KV Cache effect

The menu does not change system context or model requests, so it has no independent cache effect.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

- The menu presents the live catalogs supplied by `ui-conversation`; it does not invent descriptions for providers that supply none.
- Image and Workspace actions remain unavailable when the current Session or model disables the corresponding native capability.
